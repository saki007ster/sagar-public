Now what is a dabba? A dabba is simply a tiffin box (iconic stackable tin box) carrying home-cooked food, which is to be delivered from the home to a person in an office or a school. And a dabbawala is a person who picks up the food from the home, and ensures that it is delivered to the right office, to the right person on time. Every day, for a very modest fee, the dabbawalas collect freshly cooked meals from their customers’ homes all over Mumbai. Travelling by train, bus and bicycle, they then sort and deliver each of them to offices and workplaces throughout the city by lunchtime – and even return the used tiffins back to the customer’s home for reuse.

To satisfy their customers, they use a complex system of collection teams, sorting points and delivery zones, and a completely manual system for routing the right meal to the right destination. This labelling system must rely purely on numbers and colors, painted on the tiffin - because most of the dabbawalas are illiterate and cannot read. Despite challenges like this, the organization has been recognized and celebrated for their amazing order accuracy estimated at roughly 1 error in every 16 million transactions and has resulted in them being recognized by Forbes as being a Six Sigma organization.
