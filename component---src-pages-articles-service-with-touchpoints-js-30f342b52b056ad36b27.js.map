Here is my take on it.\n            </h3>\n            <small>MARCH 2017 - 12 mins read</small>\n          </header>\n          <section>\n            <p>\n              Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, i have seen the dabbawalas\n              all my life. I have never really given a thought into how this 125\n              year old service functions or how it can be redesigned, until i\n              got into the service design field.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              They are a very important part of life in Mumbai as they are the\n              ones who make sure that people get their lunch in time at their\n              offices or schools, everyday. Now what is a dabba? A dabba is\n              simply a tiffin box (iconic stackable tin box) carrying\n              home-cooked food, which is to be delivered from the home to a\n              person in an office or a school. And a dabbawala is a person who\n              picks up the food from the home, and ensures that it is delivered\n              to the right office, to the right person on time. Every day, for a\n              very modest fee, the dabbawalas collect freshly cooked meals from\n              their customers’ homes all over Mumbai. Travelling by train, bus\n              and bicycle, they then sort and deliver each of them to offices\n              and workplaces throughout the city by lunchtime – and even return\n              the used tiffins back to the customer’s home for reuse. It all may\n              sound fairly simple, but imagine doing this in one of the most\n              densely populated cities in the world.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Img fluid={props.data.touchpoints1.childImageSharp.fluid} alt=\"\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The dabbawala are an incredible organization of over 5000 people\n              in Mumbai. They deliver nearly 2,00,000 lunches everyday and on\n              time and what is even more impressive is the no usage of any\n              technology. The only motorized transport used is the Mumbai local\n              trains, other than that they make use of hand-drawn carts and\n              bicycles. To satisfy their customers, they use a complex system of\n              collection teams, sorting points and delivery zones, and a\n              completely manual system for routing the right meal to the right\n              destination. This labelling system must rely purely on numbers and\n              colors, painted on the tiffin - because most of the dabbawalas are\n              illiterate and cannot read. Despite challenges like this, the\n              organization has been recognized and celebrated for their amazing\n              order accuracy estimated at roughly 1 error in every 16 million\n              transactions and has resulted in them being recognized by Forbes\n              as being a Six Sigma organization. While the operations are fairly\n              simple, the dabbawalas are now beginning to work with newer\n              technologies. You can SMS them, or you can also log on to their\n              site, mydabbawala.com to avail of their services\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Img fluid={props.data.touchpoints2.childImageSharp.fluid} alt=\"\" />\n            <Img fluid={props.data.touchpoints3.childImageSharp.fluid} alt=\"\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              One of the most disturbing dichotomies of a fast growing\n              metropolitan city like Mumbai is the unequal distribution of\n              wealth, privileges and even civic amenities. To 1.6 million people\n              who have lunch everyday in Mumbai from the dabbawallahs, there are\n              close to 200,000 street and slum children who go without food for\n              days. The Happy Life Welfare society decided to give it a shot and\n              that's how the Share My Dabba initiative took off - a new idea for\n              helping to feed Mumbai’s 200,000+ slum children. \"Tonnes of food\n              gets left over and uneaten. That amount of food can feed hundreds\n              of children. That is the potential we are trying to work on,\" It\n              was vital that the solution they developed together was simple,\n              inexpensive, and does not risk delaying the dabbawala’s schedule\n              or their record of on-time delivery.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              So here’s how it works; anyone who doesn’t eat all of the food in\n              their lunch can simply place a sticker saying “Share” on the\n              tiffin of uneaten food.The dabbawala picks up the tiffins after\n              lunch as usual, and take them back to a central redistribution\n              location. Here volunteers meet them, quickly separate the tiffins\n              with “Share” stickers, remove the food in them to give to the\n              children, and then quickly repack the tiffins so the dabbawala can\n              get them back to customers’ homes on schedule. The whole process\n              takes less than 15 minutes. The food these children receive may be\n              cold, but is otherwise perfectly good, and would otherwise be\n              going to waste.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Img fluid={props.data.touchpoints4.childImageSharp.fluid} alt=\"\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Although i absolutely love the Share My Dabba initiative and the\n              intent behind it, i feel that it lacks emotional empathy. The\n              Share My Dabba works perfectly fine on the functional side of\n              things as it get food left over in dabbas to hungry street\n              children, using just a tiny Share sticker and the extensive\n              dabbawala network, however it is not enough to think only about\n              the functional aspects, but also think about what the emotional\n              state of these street children when they get this food.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Its hurting the dignity of the poor as they are given messy,\n              unwanted & leftover food. If you really want to feed a child then\n              it shouldn’t be by your leftover food. The iconic form and design\n              of the dabba (tiffin box) can be used to change that perspective.\n              Instead of pasting the share sticker on entire tiffin box, one can\n              place it on a particular section/compartment of the tiffin box.\n              This section can contain food that is packed from the homes\n              specially for these kids. During lunchtime the food in that\n              particular section/compartment will be deliberately left unopened\n              & untouched. The dabbawalas can pick up the dabbas after lunch\n              according to their regular routine and take them to their central\n              redistribution centres/ There volunteers from the Happy Life\n              Welfare Society can open these untouched sections/compartments of\n              dabbas which have the red share sticker on them and give it to the\n              kids on the street.\n            </p>\n            <span class=\"project-step-number\">01</span>\n            <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>\n            <p>\n              When designing, it is absolutely vital to empathise with the end\n              user. The ability to step into the shoes of the user, aiming to\n              understanding their feelings & perspectives and to use that\n              understanding to guide our actions. By empathising, a simple tweak\n              in the design of the system will be enough to make the children\n              feel cared for as the food has been cooked especially for them and\n              not some messy leftovers from the lunch.\n            </p>\n          </section>\n          <section className=\"article-social\">\n            <div className=\"social inner\">\n              <p className=\"article-social-heading\">share this post</p>\n              <ul className=\"icons\">\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"/\" className=\"icon alt fa-twitter\">\n                    <span className=\"label\">Twitter</span>\n                  </a>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"/\" className=\"icon alt fa-instagram\">\n                    <span className=\"label\">Instagram</span>\n                  </a>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"/\" className=\"icon alt fa-github\">\n                    <span className=\"label\">GitHub</span>\n                  </a>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"/\" className=\"icon alt fa-linkedin\">\n                    <span className=\"label\">LinkedIn</span>\n                  </a>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default ServiceWithTouchpoints\n\nexport const fluidTouchpointsImage = graphql`\n  fragment fluidTouchpointsImage on File {\n    childImageSharp {\n      fluid(maxWidth: 1000) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    coverTouchpoints: file(\n      relativePath: { eq: \"articles/touchpoints/cover-touchpoints.png\" }\n    ) {\n      ...fluidTouchpointsImage\n    }\n    touchpoints1: file(\n      relativePath: { eq: \"articles/touchpoints/touchpoints1.png\" }\n    ) {\n      ...fluidTouchpointsImage\n    }\n    touchpoints2: file(\n      relativePath: { eq: \"articles/touchpoints/touchpoints2.png\" }\n    ) {\n      ...fluidTouchpointsImage\n    }\n    touchpoints3: file(\n      relativePath: { eq: \"articles/touchpoints/touchpoints3.png\" }\n    ) {\n      ...fluidTouchpointsImage\n    }\n    touchpoints4: file(\n      relativePath: { eq: \"articles/touchpoints/touchpoints4.png\" }\n    ) {\n      ...fluidTouchpointsImage\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
